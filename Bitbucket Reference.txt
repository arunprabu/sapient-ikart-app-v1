How to Upload Daily Hands-on projects into bitbucket?
---

After the hands-on project checked out 

finally, try the following 
  git checkout -b trainer-arun/day6 (use your name instead)

To verify what's the branch selected
  git branch 

create the daywise branch. example day6
after that, add the necessary codebase inside 

Then, 
  git status       (this will show all the new/changed files)
  git add .
  git commit -m "updated for the day" 
  git push origin trainer-arun/day6    (here trainer-arun/day7 is the branch name)

  or else 
  git push -u origin trainer-arun/day6

Like this create a new daywise folder next day. and push that code also. 
Maintain all daywise projects inside one branch itself against your name.
